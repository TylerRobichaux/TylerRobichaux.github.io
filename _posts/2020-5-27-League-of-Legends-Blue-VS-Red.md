 This is an analysis on data from almost ten thousand League of Legends games. I am curious if once one of the teams build a lead, if either 
has a higher probability of closing it out(winning). To explore this idea I will look at the two teams win rates based on varying leads at 10 minutes.

First lets look at a graph that shows which team won the game, and how much gold each team had. As the graph shows and as common sense would dictate, 
as one team gains a gold lead, that team is much more likely to win the game. From looking at this alone I can not see any distinct advantage one
 team has over the other. The section of the graph that contains games where the teams has similar amounts of gold is evenly split between red and blue.

Let's look at the numbers. When the blue team had a gold lead between 500 and 1k gold Blue had a win rate of 61.3% while at the same gold lead Red had 
a winrate of 61.5%. At most gold leads both teams had similair win rates. The exceptions being when one team had a gold lead between, 2k-2.5k, 3.5k-4k, 
and 4k-4.5k. With a gold lead of 2k-2.5k, and 3.5k-4k gold Blue team won 4.4%, and 3.2% more games than Red team with the same gold lead. However at 
a gold lead of 4k-4.5k Red team won 4.9% more games than Blue did. however, these variances are not particularly big, and it is not in one teams favor,
 so I do not think they really say anything about the balance between the teams. Infact, if you take the winrate of both teams once each had a gold lead 
from 500 to 6.5k they had vary similar win rates. blue teams win rate was 82.05, and Red teams winrate was 82.5. So once you average out each teams win 
rates they are very similiar.
  
  A gold Lead isnt the only type of lead you can have though. So Lets take a look at neutral objectives.

This definitely seems to be telling a story. With a neutral objective lead Blue team seems to win more often pretty consistently. However, what this 
graph doesnt show is that Red team gets the first dragon 9.4% more often than Blue. So I think what this says is that Red team has an inate advatage 
when it comes to taking the first dragon. The games when blue does manage to get the dragon, it is likly that they already had a lead of some kind that 
enabled them to take the first dragon. sadly though, I have run out of time and my project is due. I will have to perhaps explore this further.
  
  
  
  
  
  
here are 2 bonus graphs I made. I decided to convert them into the scatter plot seen above.
